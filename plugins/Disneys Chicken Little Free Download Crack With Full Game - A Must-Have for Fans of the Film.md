Mickey is a young and curious mouse who works as an apprentice for a powerful and mysterious sorcerer named Yen Sid. Every day, Mickey has to carry heavy buckets of water up a long and steep staircase to fill a well in the sorcerer's tower. He admires Yen Sid's magical abilities and wishes he could learn some of his spells. One night, when Yen Sid goes to bed, Mickey sees his chance to try on the sorcerer's hat, which seems to be the source of his magic. He puts on the hat and feels a surge of energy. He decides to use his newfound magic to make his work easier. He points his finger at a broomstick and commands it to come to life and fetch water for him. The broomstick obeys and starts to carry the buckets up and down the stairs. Mickey is delighted and decides to take a nap on the sorcerer's chair, dreaming that he is the world's greatest sorcerer. However, he does not realize that the broomstick does not stop fetching water. It keeps filling the well until it overflows. The water spills out of the tower and floods the whole area. Mickey wakes up and sees the disaster. He tries to stop the broomstick, but it does not listen to him. He grabs an ax and chops the broomstick into pieces. He thinks he has solved the problem, but he is wrong. The pieces of wood magically grow into hundreds of new brooms, each one carrying a bucket of water. The army of brooms continues to flood the tower until Yen Sid returns and sees the mess. He uses his magic to stop the water and the brooms. He glares at Mickey, who looks ashamed and scared. He makes a gesture of apology and begs for forgiveness. Yen Sid does not say a word, but he points at the buckets and the stairs, indicating that Mickey has to resume his work as punishment for his mischief.

Mickey picks up a bucket and starts to walk up the stairs. He feels exhausted and miserable. He looks at the sorcerer's hat with longing and regret. He wonders if he will ever get another chance to use it. He thinks about how much fun he had when he first brought the broomstick to life. He remembers how he waved his finger and made the stars dance in the sky. He wishes he could do that again.

Meanwhile, Yen Sid watches Mickey from his bedroom window. He shakes his head and sighs. He knows that Mickey is a good-hearted mouse, but also a reckless and foolish one. He thinks about how he found Mickey on the streets, hungry and cold. He took him in and gave him a home and a job. He hoped to teach him some magic someday, but he wanted him to learn discipline and responsibility first. He wonders if he was too harsh on him. He thinks about how much potential Mickey has. He wishes he could help him grow.
  
Suddenly, Yen Sid hears a loud noise. He looks out of the window and sees a bright flash of light. He runs to the tower and sees Mickey standing on the roof, wearing the sorcerer's hat again. He has a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eyes. He is surrounded by fireworks and music. He waves his finger and makes the brooms dance with him. He looks at Yen Sid and says, "I'm sorry, master, but I just had to try it one more time. Please don't be mad at me. Look what I can do!"
