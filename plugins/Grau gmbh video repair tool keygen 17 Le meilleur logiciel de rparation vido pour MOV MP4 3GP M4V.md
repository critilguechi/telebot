## Step 1: Download and Install Grau Gmbh Video Repair Tool
 
You can download Grau Gmbh Video Repair Tool from their official website: [https://main.grauonline.de/video-repair-tool/](https://main.grauonline.de/video-repair-tool/). The software is available for Windows and Mac OS X. The download file is a zip archive that contains the executable file and the license key generator.
 
After downloading the zip file, extract it to a folder on your computer. You will see two files: `gs.exe` and `keygen.bat` (for Windows) or `keygen.sh` (for Mac). The `gs.exe` file is the main program that you will use to repair your videos. The `keygen.bat` or `keygen.sh` file is a script that will generate a license key for you to activate the software.
 
## Step 2: Generate a License Key and Activate the Software
 
To use Grau Gmbh Video Repair Tool, you need to activate it with a license key. The license key is based on the current hour and minute of your system clock. You can generate a license key by running the `keygen.bat` or `keygen.sh` file in the same folder as the `gs.exe` file.
 
To run the keygen script on Windows, double-click on the `keygen.bat` file. A command prompt window will open and display a license key for you. Copy the license key to your clipboard.
 
To run the keygen script on Mac, open a terminal window and navigate to the folder where you extracted the zip file. Then type `sh keygen.sh` and press enter. The terminal window will display a license key for you. Copy the license key to your clipboard.
 
Next, run the `gs.exe` file to launch Grau Gmbh Video Repair Tool. You will see a dialog box asking you to enter your license key. Paste the license key from your clipboard into the text box and click OK. The software will be activated and ready to use.
